          <I18nSpan text="Why does this website exist?" />
        </h4>
        <p class={style.p}>
          In 2020 I started playing StarCraft again. I tried looking for some
          maps that I had previously played but I was unable to find them. So I
          created this website to solve my map searching problem. The site
          launched on 2021-02-28 under the domain name 'bounding.net' and has
          since grown significantly in both scope and scale.
        </p>

        <h4 class={style.h4}>
          <I18nSpan text="What does scmscx.com mean?" />
        </h4>
        <p class={style.p}>
          StarCraft maps come in two file extensions, .scm (for original
          StarCraft) and .scx (for the expansion, Brood War). The domain name is
          the concatenation of the two map file formats: scmscx.
        </p>

        <h4 class={style.h4}>
          <I18nSpan text="Why do we need another map database website?" />
        </h4>
        <p class={style.p}>
          Most popular map websites have limited functionality, typically
          offering little more than basic name search and a list of download
          links. Finding a map still involves a lot of manual effort digging
          through each map file.
        </p>

        <p class={style.p}>
          There's a lot of map info buried inside map files that this website
          will help you search and preview across all maps without downloading a
          single file. Want to search for maps with a particular unit name? Want
          to find maps similar to a specific map? Want to see what the minimap
          looks like? This website helps you find maps by almost any criteria
          very quickly, and it shows you rich map information instantly without
          downloading a file.
        </p>

        <p class={style.p}>
          I'm also focused on making this website a streamlined tool. I want
          everything to load fast and with no ads.
        </p>

        <h4 class={style.h4}>
          <I18nSpan text="How do I play the maps after I have downloaded from here?" />
        </h4>
        <p class={style.p}>
          In order to play a map after you have downloaded it, you need to move
          it from your web browser's download folder (on Windows this is usually
          the 'Download' folder) to your StarCraft downloads folder. Your
          StarCraft downloads folder is usually located at "My
          Documents\StarCraft\Maps\Download" (on Windows). After that, you
          should be able to find it in the "Downloads" folder inside the
          StarCraft lobby creation menu.
        </p>

        <h4 class={style.h4}>
          <I18nSpan text="How many maps does the database have?" />
        </h4>
        <p class={style.p}>
          The amount of maps can be seen over on the statistics page. But this
          answer mostly depends on what the definition of a "map" is. While
          there are no exact byte-for-byte duplicates in the database, there are
          many maps that are very similar and potentially even indistinguishable
          from each other.

          <I18nSpan text="Can I contribute maps to the database?" />

          Launched the new UI, it has been completely rewritten in solidjs. This
          will hopefully make it easier to maintain and develop new features.
          There are several new features launching with the new UI as well, such
          as:
        </p>
        <ul class={style.ul}>
          <li>
            Greatly improved search experience, with infinite scrolling of
            results. Searches are also now cached, so searching again in the
            near future will be very fast.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved map display, things like the forces are now rendered in a
            way that is familiar to players of the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Greatly improved Korean translations, the vast majority of the users
            of the site speak Korean so it has been a long time coming for this
            one.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the first time, Chinese translations. The third largest language
            group of users are Chinese speakers, so this should also be a big
            win.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accessability improvements, many pages on the old UI were using
            confusing markup which likely did not work well with screen readers
            and other accessibility tools. The new UI is tremendously more
            standard in its markup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Uploading maps has been greatly improved. This is partly due to
            http3, and partly due to a lot of client frontend work. Uploads now
            really happen in parallel, and when they fail they can be retried. I
            have rewritten the upload page several times, hopefully this is the
            last time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class={style.p}>
          There were also a number of infrastructure changes that just preceded
          the new UI launching. These include:
        </p>
        <ul class={style.ul}>
          <li>
            Containerization of all relevant services. Postgres, the web app,
            the reverse proxy, as well as all the build infrastructure, are now
            in podman containers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Containerizing haproxy as well as certbot proved to be too
            complicated, so I switched to caddy. This also has the benefit of
            adding http3 support, as haproxy still does not have http3 compiled
            in by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            Switching to cloudflare for the domain servers. They have a better
            api than namecheap's domain servers.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Some features that existed in the old UI are not yet reimplemented in
          the new UI. They will gradually make their way over. Probably the
          largest thing missing is the fully rendered map previews. They will
          return.

          I have also decided to start a devlog where I record the changes I
          make and do a little bit of behind the scenes exposition. I'll try to
          retroactively add in some points in the timeline that are interesting.
